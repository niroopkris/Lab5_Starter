1) For simply testing if this "message" feature works or not, then no I would not make that a unit test, as that's somewhat of a vague and unnecessary test. I feel like for broader functions like this, you want to make unit tests for specific aspects of it, such as if it correctly meets certain conditions (ex: within a given length) or if it is invalid in any way.
2) Yes, because unlike the previous example, this is a very specific and self-contained feature that can be tested for easily by taking a message input and seeing if it meets the "less than 80 characters" condition.
